How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, Media Queries

This was one of the first projects that I did that I was immediately proud of. I had fun creating it. I created this project by doing the HTML and CSS for it simultaneously which I found extremely helpful and efficient. Prior to this I was doing the complete Html first then going back in and completing the CSS.

Optimizations


Looking back at this code and complete site with fresh eyes, I am still extremely proud of it but I would change a couple of things. One in particular would be the footer. I would like to get the font on the left side a little bigger!

Lessons Learned:
I learned that footers can be intricate and also that I enjoy doing both the Css and Html simultaneously, section by section.
